# The contents of this file can also be set using the `xdg-settings` command:
#
#     $ xdg-settings set default-web-browser org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser.desktop
#
# Note that applications must be specified (both in this file and via 
# `xdg-settings`) using their full desktop file names.  For a while, I was 
# having trouble because I assumed that the qutebrowser file was named 
# `qutebrowser.desktop`.  Specifying the wrong name in this file basically just 
# causes this file to be ignored.  Specifying the wrong name to `xdg-settings` 
# does trigger an error code, but no error message.
